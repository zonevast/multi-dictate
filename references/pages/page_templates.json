Implement widget-level lazy loading\n2. Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data\n3. Use Web Workers for data processing\n4. Implement incremental loading for large datasets\n5. Optimize bundle size with code splitting\n\nImplementation Steps:\n1. Dashboard Audit (2 hours)\n   - Measure current performance metrics\n   - Identify bottlenecks using Chrome DevTools\n   - Map user interaction patterns\n\n2. Caching Implementation (4 hours)\n   - Set up Redis for API response caching\n   - Implement client-side caching strategies\n   - Add cache invalidation logic\n\n3. Lazy Loading (3 hours)\n   - Implement intersection observer for widgets\n   - Add loading states and skeletons\n   - Optimize initial critical rendering path\n\n4. Performance Monitoring (1 hour)\n   - Add performance metrics tracking\n   - Set up alerts for performance degradation\n\nExpected Outcome:\n- Initial load time: 3s \u2192 1.2s (60% improvement)\n- Interaction responsiveness: 500ms \u2192 100ms\n- Mobile performance score: 45 \u2192 85\n\nTesting Strategy:\n- Lighthouse performance testing\n- Real user monitoring (RUM)\n- Load testing with simulated concurrent users"
